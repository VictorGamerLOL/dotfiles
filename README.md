# My dotfiles

Why are you here?

There is really nothing interesting here.

My polybar is literally the default but a little tweaked.

What this thing mostly has to offer is my ZSH config with a modified starship.rs powerline prompt.

And some window manager configs.

Required packages if you want to use zsh:

`starship`

And you gonna need to make an `openaiapirc` in your .config with your OpenAI api credentials for zsh_codex

Anything else is use it or not.
